<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Software Enginner and a Medical Laboratory Scientist based in West Africa,
  I love coding as much as i love diagnostic research.  
</p>

<p>I started my career as a salesman, a copier salesman to be specific, young, hungry, and hardworking,<br /> but the reality was that I was just one of the thousands of young Nigerian graduates, all eager to succeed.</p>
